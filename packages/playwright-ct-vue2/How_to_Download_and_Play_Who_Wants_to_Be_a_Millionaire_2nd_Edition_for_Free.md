However, if you don't have the original game disc or you want to play it on a different device, you might be wondering how to download and play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2nd Edition for free. In this article, we will show you how to do that in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Find a reliable source for the game file
 
The first thing you need to do is to find a website that offers the game file for Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2nd Edition. There are many websites that claim to provide free downloads for old games, but not all of them are trustworthy or safe. Some of them might contain viruses, malware, or unwanted software that can harm your device or compromise your privacy.
 
One of the websites that we recommend is Old Games Download[^1^]. This website has a large collection of classic games for various platforms, including Windows, PlayStation, and Game Boy Color. All the games are tested and verified by the website's staff, and they provide detailed instructions on how to install and run them. You can also find screenshots, videos, and reviews for each game.
 
## Step 2: Download the game file for your preferred platform
 
Once you have found the website that offers the game file for Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2nd Edition, you need to choose which platform you want to play it on. The game was released for Windows, PlayStation, and Game Boy Color in 2000, so you need to download the corresponding file for your device.
 
For example, if you want to play it on Windows, you need to download the file Who\_Wants\_to\_Be\_a\_Millionaire\_2nd\_Edition\_Win\_ISO\_EN.zip (490.4MB) from Old Games Download[^1^]. If you want to play it on PlayStation, you need to download the file Who\_Wants\_to\_Be\_a\_Millionaire\_2nd\_Edition\_PS\_ROM\_Europe\_SLES-03589.zip (241.9MB) from the same website[^1^]. If you want to play it on Game Boy Color, you need to download the file Who\_Wants\_To\_Be\_A\_Millionaire\_2nd\_Edition.gbc (0.5MB) from Arcade Spot[^2^].
 
## Step 3: Extract and run the game file
 
After you have downloaded the game file for Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2nd Edition, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get an ISO file (for Windows or PlayStation) or a GBC file (for Game Boy Color) that contains the game data.
 
To run the game file, you need an emulator that can simulate the original platform's hardware and software. An emulator is a program that allows you to play old games on modern devices without any compatibility issues. There are many emulators available online for free, but some of them might require additional configuration or plugins.
 
For example, if you want to play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2nd Edition on Windows, you need an emulator like ePSXe or PCSX-Reloaded that can run PlayStation games. You also need a BIOS file that contains the PlayStation's firmware and a plugin that enables graphics and sound. You can find these files online or extract them from your own PlayStation console if you have one.
 
If you want to play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2nd Edition on Game Boy Color, you need an emulator like VisualBoyAdvance or BGB that can run Game Boy Color games. You don't need any additional files or plugins for these emulators.
