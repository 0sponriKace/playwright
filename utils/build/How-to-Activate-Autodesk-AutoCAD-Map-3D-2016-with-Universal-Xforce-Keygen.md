Autodesk AutoCAD Map 3D 2016 is not only a powerful software for creating and managing spatial data, but also a toolset that can boost your productivity and efficiency. According to a study by Autodesk[^1^], the Map 3D toolset provided up to 60% overall productivity gain compared with basic AutoCAD, when these tasks were performed by an experienced AutoCAD user:

- Creating and editing geometry with coordinate systems
- Importing and exporting GIS data
- Styling and theming GIS data
- Creating and editing annotation
- Creating and editing surfaces
- Creating and editing alignments
- Creating and editing profiles
- Creating and editing parcels
- Creating and editing pipe networks

With the Map 3D toolset, you can access and use data from various sources, such as ESRI SHP files, Oracle Spatial databases, or web services. You can also apply different styles and themes to your data, such as color ramps, gradient fills, or thematic maps. You can also create and edit annotation that is linked to your data, such as labels, tables, or legends. You can also create and edit surfaces that represent the elevation or slope of your terrain. You can also create and edit alignments that define the horizontal and vertical geometry of your roads or railways. You can also create and edit profiles that show the elevation changes along your alignments. You can also create and edit parcels that define the boundaries of your land or property. You can also create and edit pipe networks that represent the underground utilities or drainage systems.
 
By using the Map 3D toolset, you can save time and effort in creating and managing your spatial data. You can also improve the quality and accuracy of your data, as well as the visual appeal of your maps and models. You can also enhance your collaboration and communication with other stakeholders, such as engineers, planners, or contractors.
